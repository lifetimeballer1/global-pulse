# Global Pulse maintenance archive manifest

The canonical runtime is now `global_pulse_core.js`, `global_pulse_event_pipeline.js`, `global_pulse_tokens.css`, `global_map_ui.py`, and `refresh_pipeline.py`.

## Superseded V2.2–V2.7 renderers

`global_pulse_v22.js`, `global_pulse_v23.js`, `global_pulse_v24.js`, `global_pulse_v25.js`, `global_pulse_v26.js`, `global_pulse_v27.js`, and `global_pulse_v27_quality.js` were reviewed for unique behavior before consolidation. Their durable behavior is represented by the canonical core: trend/history, source health, conflict modal behavior, climate/humanitarian context, climate-to-conflict evidence pathways, market health, duplicate map hygiene, Morse/source visibility, and evidence-quality indicators.

They have been removed from the runtime and are no longer required by the canonical refresh pipeline.

## One-time install/migration scripts

The remaining `install_*.py` files are migration/installers rather than runtime services. They should not be added to production automation unless a specific migration is still required.

The following legacy installers have already been removed from the active tree after their runtime behavior was consolidated or superseded:

- `install_event_intelligence.py`
- `update7_live_branding.py`

The canonical pipeline no longer invokes these installers. `global_map_ui.py` and `clean_index.py` own the canonical map/index installation behavior.

## Event build consolidation

`build_event_history.py`, `build_event_intelligence.py`, `build_event_consistency.py`, `build_event_resolution.py`, and `build_event_market_impact.py` are orchestrated by `build_event_pipeline.py`. Their generated artifacts remain separate because downstream evidence consumers use those stable artifact names. `global_pulse_event_pipeline.js` is the canonical UI surface for the five outputs.

The old event renderers have been removed from the runtime.

## CSS consolidation

`global_pulse_intelligence.css`, `global_pulse_list_density.css`, and `global_pulse_phase3.css` were audited and their durable layout, mobile-containment, list-density, dialog-lock, and intelligence-panel rules were merged into `global_pulse_tokens.css`. The token file is now the single shared source for spacing, type scale, colors, numeric typography, and these durable UI rules. The old stylesheets are safe to archive after independent installer workflows stop referencing them.

## Validation consolidation

The obsolete Phase 3 validation workflow and its tests were removed because they asserted the presence of superseded installer assets instead of validating the canonical runtime. Current regression coverage belongs in `tests/test_regressions.py` and the canonical refresh/security gates.
